**Mod ID:** no_portal_storm  
**Name of the Mod:** Disable portal storm  
**Description of the Mod:** If you still don't like portal storm even it can't hurt NPCs anymore, USE THIS. owo b  

## What does the Mod does?

In short, disable **Portal Storm**.  
In my test, I can still spawn **Portal Storm** or **Early Portal Storm** but the storm immediately disappear at the next moment.  
But I do another test. If the storm has already existed, they wouldn't disappear immediately. Instead, **Portal Storm** will pass just like normal but **Early Portal Storm** wouldn't pass away.  
So, if the **Early Portal Storm** has already existed before adding the Mod. You have to Wait untill the **Portal Storm** comes or later, then add the Mod.

## How to Use

You will only need the `no_portal_storm` folder to use the mod.  
Just put the folder into `where_ever_you_put_your_game\data\mods`.
