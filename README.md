**Name of the Mod:** Disable portal storm<br>

## What does the Mod does?

In short, it disable **Portal Storm**.


In my test, I wait untill the **Early Portal Storm** nearly comes. And one save had not included **"Disable Portal Storm" Mod** and one had the **Mod**. It turn out the save which had the **Mod** added, successfully stopped **Early Portal Storm** from spawn naturally.<br>
I also had a test on spawning **Early Portal Storm** and **Portal Storm** using **Debug Mode**. The result is I can still spawn **Early Portal Storm** or **Portal Storm** but the storm immediately disappear at the next moment.


But I did another test. If the storm was already existed, they would not disappear immediately. Instead, **Portal Storm** will pass away just like normal, but **Early Portal Storm** would not pass away.<br>
So, if the **Early Portal Storm** was already existed before adding the **Mod**. You should Wait untill the **Portal Storm** comes or later, then add the **Mod**. So that, the **Early Portal Storm** will gone or it will by there forever.


-Also, a good way to disable portal storm without editing game files yourself. owo-
